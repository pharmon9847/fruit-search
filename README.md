# **fruit-search project**

## Build an Autofill Search Bar for various types of fruit

If a userâ€™s typed input is contained anywhere in one of the fruits in the list, then a drop down will appear containing all the fruits which match. As a user continues to add letters to their input, new dropdowns will populate. When a user clicks on one of these options, it will populate in the search bar.
